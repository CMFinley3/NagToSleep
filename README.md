# NagToSleep

Nag to Sleep is a program that sends notifications every minute when it gets close to bed time and eventually, shutting dowmn your computer at a desginated bed time.

The program is in a usable state for my own needs, but I still want to create a more portable build with more customization for the program behavior.

To run the program, run
```
./gradlew build
```
and then modify launch.bat to contain the directory to your copy of javafx. At which point running launch.bat should launch the program.
